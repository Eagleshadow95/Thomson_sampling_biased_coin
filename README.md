# Thomson_sampling_biased_coin
This repository contains an implementation of the Thompson Sampling algorithm to solve the Multi-Armed Bandit problem, specifically applied to a scenario with biased coins. 
Features
*Thompson Sampling Implementation*: A robust implementation of the Thompson Sampling algorithm to handle multiple biased coins.
*Biased Coin Simulation*: A simulation environment to represent biased coins, each with a different probability of landing heads.
*Performance Metrics*: Tools to evaluate the performance of the algorithm, including cumulative rewards and regret.
*Visualization*: Graphical representation of the learning process, including reward distribution and selection frequency of each coin.
*Customizable Parameters*: Easy-to-tune parameters for the number of trials, number of coins, and their respective biases.
